# Roadmap

## Upcoming

### Ural Upgrade
The Ural hardfork introduces one significant feature in this upgrade.
1. Support bucket migration: With this new feature, users can migrate their bucket to another storage provider(SP) as
   the primary SP if they are not satisfied with the current service provided.

### Pawnee Upgrade
The Pawnee hardfork will introduce several enhance features in this upgrade.
1. Support atomic object update: To update an object currently, the process involves deleting the existing object on the
   chain and then creating a new object with the same name. This feature enables users to directly modify the content of
   objects. For further information, please refer to [BEP346](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/pull/346).
2. Support delete object in created status: Currently, objects in the 'created' state can only be deleted through a
   'cancel create' transaction. This feature enables users to send deletion transactions for objects in any state.
