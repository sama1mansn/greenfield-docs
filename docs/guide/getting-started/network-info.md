The [RPC Endpoints](../../api/endpoints.md) you may need to know to connect to Greenfield.

## Bridge

Greenfield is a blockchain system that operates independently, but is connected to BNB Smart Chain (BSC). In order to move
assets between Greenfield and BNB Smart Chain (BSC), users can utilize the [BNB Greenfield Bridge](https://greenfield.bnbchain.org/en/bridge)
or [DCellar](https://dcellar.io).

## Block Explorers

- [GreenfieldScan](https://greenfieldscan.com), developed by TraceReal.
- [BSC Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.bscscan.com)

## DCellar
[DCellar](https://dcellar.io), as the inaugural application built on the BNB Greenfield, serves as an ultimate client of the BNB Greenfield network. Besides Basic file management and asset management functions, DCellar can also greatly assist developers in comprehending the functionalities of Greenfield:
